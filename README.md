[![smollm2](https://snapcraft.io/smollm2/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/smollm2)

SmolLM2 is a compact large language model (LLM) developed by Hugging Face, designed for efficient natural language tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question answering.

Use this snap to quickly install an optimized environment for local inference with SmolLM2.

The snap includes the following hardware-optimized inference engines:

* cpu: Optimized for x64 and ARM (armv8, armv9) CPUs
* intel-cpu: OpenVINO acceleration for Intel CPUs
* intel-gpu: OpenVINO acceleration for supported Intel GPUs
* nvidia-gpu: CUDA-enabled GPU acceleration

The most suitable engine is automatically selected based on the available hardware.

#### Install
```shell
sudo snap install smollm2
```

#### Run
```shell
smollm2
```

> [!TIP]
> Some accelerators require extra [drivers](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/inference-snaps/how-to/setup/drivers/) to be usable with this snap.
